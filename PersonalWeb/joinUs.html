                <p>This game is a passion project that I have been working on 
                    for the past 2 years that started out as an idea one night
                     after seeing the colors of the dice that we got. I know it's 
                     kind of a stretch a game from just colors but if you think 
                     about it wasn't the colors it was the creativity in me that 
                     was been fed from other games, stories, tales, movies, cartoons 
                     and the desire from my childhood to make a game that my 
                     family and friends can enjoy maybe even other people like 
                     all of you that are reading this right now, thank you for 
                     that, so since you read all of this and have been apart of 
                     the journey so far why not continue and join us. By joining 
                     the waiting list you are supporting me and motivating me to 
                     achieve my dream while sharing the dream of one day releasing 
                     this game. The waiting list is for me to know that you have been 
                     here from the start and for you to be notified of new updates I 
                     will be posting blog updates throughout the development so 
                     everyone can also give me suggestions and later on give me 
                     feedback when the game gets an alpha release, also everyone 
                     on the waiting list will get a special gift when the game releases.</p>
