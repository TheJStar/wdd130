        Thee dice game \n A game where magic flows through your dice, your sitting in front of a table surrounded by your friends and
        all of you having the power to win the battle and embrace all glory. This game is a turn based strategy multiplayer where the last one standing wins.
        You all have 10 dice and 6 unique spells based on your character and you use the dice to cast spells and unleash chaos. It may seem like it's all random but through the ancient technique of dice freezing 
        you can build your greatest attacks and combos with strategy and come out victories. 
        This website is for introducing my game to everyone who visits it, keeping people informed on the progress on my game, the journey that it goes through,
        and later where you can download the game, give me feedback, get notified of events.

        Blog update #2 - Dice creation 11/03/2023
        Hello again everyone, at the currant time the dice have been with there required functions have been made(dice roll, dice freeze, casting spells, dice selection). 
        The currant way that the dice are working may not be in the final product but it is working as required for the time being and here is a bit of a sneak peak.
        Blog Update #1 - The Beginning - 10/03/2023
        Hello everyone, welcome to the first blog update for the game currently the game is being digitalized in unity. This will be quite 
        the process since the reason I am doing the digitalization is one for because I want to add a lot of visuals to it a tell a better story 
        by creating it's own world and second so when the alpha releases I can have a player base that will give me feedback and I can balance the game more.
        Other than that the game itself is pretty much finished rule wise so it's only a matter of time before you can experience the game.

        This game is a passion project that I have been working on for the past 2 years that started out as an idea one night after seeing the colors of the dice 
        that we got. I know it's kind of a stretch a game from just colors but if you think about it wasn't the colors it was the creativity in me that 
        was been fed from other games, stories, tales, movies, cartoons and the desire from my childhood to make a game that my family and friends 
        can enjoy maybe even other people like all of you that are reading this right now, thank you for that, so since you read all of this and have been apart of the journey so far why not continue 
        and join us.
        By joining the waiting list you are supporting me and motivating me to achieve my dream while sharing the dream of one day releasing this game. The waiting list is for me to know 
        that you have been here from the start and for you to be notified of new updates I will be posting blog updates throughout 
        the development so everyone can also give me suggestions and later on give me feedback when the game gets an alpha release,
        also everyone on the waiting list will get a special gift when the game releases.
